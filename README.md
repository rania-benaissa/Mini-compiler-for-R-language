## Context

This project is a part of the compilation lectures taken in M1 at USTHB. For further explanations, please check the [project description (in french)](project_description.pdf) and the [project report (in french)](project_report.pdf).

## Features
This project is a simple compiler for R language. It includes:
* A lexical analyzer.
* A parser.
* Symbols table generation.
* Semantic errors detection such as:
  * Division by zero.
  * Type incompatibility between variables, constants and arrays.
  * Undeclared identifiers.
  * An identifier's double declaration (only when the identifier's type is mentionned).
* Intermediate code (quadruples).
* Code generation in assembly.
	
## Technologies
This compiler is created with:
* MingW
* Flex version: 2.4.1 
* Bison version: 2.5.4a
	
## Usage 
To run the compiler, clone this repo to your desktop and open it in your ***command prompt*** then run the ***com.bat*** file as following :

```
$ com

```
To analyze a code exemple in R, all that's left to do is to create a new file with a ***".txt"*** extension then run this code:

```
$ compil <file_name.txt

```

You can also edit the existing file "test.txt" and test it:

```
$ compil <test.txt

```

## Exemple

Let's compile the following code exemple writing in R (in test.txt file). 

```R

#This is a test 

INTEGER AB <- 2

NUMERIC C <- 385.5

INTEGER ABBA

D <- AB - 5 + 2 * ABBA
WHILE ( (AB != 0) )
{
  
     C <- C/2.0
}

```
